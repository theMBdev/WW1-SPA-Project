The British realized that they'd need new technology to break the stalemate, and began the 'Landship Project' to develop the equivalent of a ship to operate on land. They deployed the first tank, the Mark I, in September, 1916, and the world was forever changed.",

The First World War involved a great modernizing of armies, weapons, and tactics, and as the very nature of war changed from offensive to static, so too did the weapons needed to fight that war.",
